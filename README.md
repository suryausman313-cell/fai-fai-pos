# Fai-Fai POS (Demo)
Simple demo Point-of-Sale web app (static) with:
- Homepage (POS)
- Login page (mock)
- Admin panel (mock)
- Basic product list + add to cart
This is a lightweight static prototype you can open in a browser.

## How to run
1. Download and unzip `fai-fai-pos.zip`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click).
3. Admin panel: open `admin.html`.
4. Login page (mock): open `login.html`.

This is a static prototype for demonstration. To make it a real app, you'd add a backend (Node/Express, DB) and authentication.
